# Contributing to Uhpenry Examples

Thanks for your interest in helping improve Uhpenry!

## How to Contribute

If you want to add examples in new programming languages or improve existing ones, here’s the best way to do it:

1. **Fork the repository** to your own GitHub account.

2. **Create a new branch** for your work (for example, `add-python-example`).
   **Important:** Never commit or merge directly to the `rotate` branch — it’s reserved only for core Uhpenry key updates and is protected to keep it secure.

3. **Add your example code** inside the `src/examples/` folder, in a new subfolder named after the language you’re adding (like `python/` or `go/`).

4. Include a **README.md** inside your example folder that explains:

   - How to run the example
   - Any setup or dependencies required
   - A short summary of what the example demonstrates

5. Make sure your code is clean, well-commented, and easy to understand.

6. **Test your example carefully** so it works as expected.

7. When you’re ready, submit a **Pull Request** from your branch to the `main` branch of this repository, describing clearly what you added or changed.

## No direct `rotate` branch changes?

- The `rotate` branch is protected and only used for key rotation and security-sensitive updates.
- This keeps critical security processes isolated and safe.
- Contributors should always base their work off `main` or feature branches for examples and improvements.
