# Contributing to Uhpenry Examples

Thank you for your interest in contributing!

## How to Contribute

If you'd like to add examples in other programming languages or improve existing ones, please follow these guidelines:

1. **Fork the repository**.

2. **Create a new branch** for your work.  
   _Never merge directly to the `rotate` branch_, as it is reserved for Uhpenry core updates.

3. **Add your example** under `src/examples/` in a new folder named for the language, e.g., `python`, `go`, `ruby`.

4. Provide a **README.md** inside your example folder that includes:

   - How to run the example.
   - Any setup or dependencies.
   - A short explanation of the example flow.

5. Ensure your code is clear, well-commented, and easy to follow.

6. **Test your example** thoroughly to make sure it works correctly.

7. Submit a **Pull Request** from your branch with a clear description of what you added or changed.
